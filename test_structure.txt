Checking Border structure:

Line 252: <Border Grid.Row="2" Style="{StaticResource DiscountCardStyle}">
  Line 253: <Grid>
    ...content...
  Line 580: </Border>  <- This should close the Border from line 252
Line 581: </Grid>  <- This should close the Grid from line 253

Line 583: <!-- Splitter -->
Line 584: <GridSplitter Grid.Column="1"  <- ERROR LINE

The issue seems to be that the Border starting at line 252 is not properly closed.
Let me check if line 580 </Border> belongs to line 548 Border instead.
